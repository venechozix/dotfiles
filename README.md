# My updated dotfiles/configurations

this repo is aimed for me to be able so sync my configurations across devices, 
if you like my configurations feel free to use them,
i'll try to make everything as generalized as possible for this purpose


## How to use

```shell
git clone https://github.com/venechozix/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
chmod +x sync.py
./sync.py -U
```

## Todo

- Actually make the script work lol

- .sh variation of the script (i might not do this tbh)

## Current configurations

- None
